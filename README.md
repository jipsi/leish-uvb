Background: The steady state balance between stromal and immune cells can be perturbed by environmental stimuli such as UVB light. Little is known about how UVB changes stromal-immune cell cross talk during skin infection.  

Methods: We used a novel murine model of Leishmania donovani infection whereby mice are pre-conditioned and maintained with minimally-erythematous UVB exposure. We used flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to examine skin cell phenotype before and after UVB exposure, infection or a combination of both. We further used ligand-receptor databases and computational tools to interpret pathways of cellular cross-talk. 

Results: We report a cell atlas of C57BL/6 mouse skin following UVB exposure, L. donovani infection and the combination of both. We characterise single cells (FACS and scRNA-seq) and predict spatial location using the 10X Genomics Visium platform. We identify phenotypic differences between groups to show that under conventional conditions (non-UVB exposed) Ccl2 transcripts are globally upregulated and CD45-Ter119-CD31-PDPN+ stromal cells increase in abundance in skin of mice infected with L. donovani. UVB exposure alone induces changes to gene signatures associated with metabolic change, notably upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in macrophages, T cells and fibroblasts. UVB exposure alters immune cell profile of infected mice, with an increase in the abundance of Ifng+ T cells and a shift in predicted pathways of intercellular communication.  In infected, non-UVB exposed mice, the Cd34â€“Selp pathway was predicted to be the dominant route of communication between fibroblasts, T cells and endothelial cells. However, in UVB-exposed infected mice, this was replaced by Itgb2-Icam2 signalling, with heightened expression of Itgb2 on Ifng+ T cells. 

Conclusion: We show that UVB exposure can significantly modify the cellular landscape and mode of intercellular communication in the skin during L. donovani infection. Our data exemplify the potential importance of including UVB pre-exposure in translational models of cutaneous infection.
